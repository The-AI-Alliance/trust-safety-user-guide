# How to Contribute to This Document

We welcome your contributions to this User Guide. The sources for this guide are in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-user-guide){:target="tsug-repo"}. Please either [post issues](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-user-guide/issues){:target="tsug-repo"} or contribute changes as [pull requests](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-user-guide/pulls){:target="tsug-repo"}. Notice that every page has _Edit this page on GitHub_ links, making it easy to view a page, then go straight to the source to make edits and submit a PR! This is the best way to help us fix typos and make similar small edits. The README also describes our "DCO" requirements, which you should understand first.

The [README](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-user-guide){:target="tsug-repo"} for the User Guide source repo explains more details for testing the website locally and for creating more extensive changes as PRs, such as adding new content.
