# How to Contribute to the AI Trust and Safety User Guide

We welcome your contributions to this user guide. You are welcome to join the AI Alliance [Trust and Safety Work Group](https://thealliance.ai/working-groups/trust-safety){:target="join-us"}, but there are other ways to contribute, too.

If you want to join our work group, complete the form on [this page](https://thealliance.ai/working-groups/trust-safety#trust-and-safety-form){:target="join-us"}. Thank you for your interest!

Because the sources for this guide are in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-user-guide){:target="tsug-repo"}, you can also [post issues](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-user-guide/issues){:target="tsug-repo"} or contribute changes as [pull requests](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-user-guide/pulls){:target="tsug-repo"}. 

Notice that every page has [{{ site.gh_edit_link_text }}]({{ site.gh_edit_repository }}/{{ page.path }}){:id="edit-this-page" target="doc_repo_page"} links, making it easy to view a page, then go straight to the source to make edits and submit a PR! This is the best way to help us fix typos and make similar small edits. The [repo's README](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-user-guide){:target="tsug-repo"} also describes our "DCO" requirements, which you should understand before submitting PRs, and it explains more details about testing the website locally, etc.
