# Glossary of Terms

Let's define the common terms we use. Some of the terms defined here are industry standards, while others are not standard, but they are useful for our purposes.

Some definitions are adapted from the following sources, which are indicated below using the same numbers, i.e., [\[1\]](#mlc) and [\[2\]](#nist):

> **Note:** For simplicity, we will sometimes refer to sending queries to an [AI System](#ai-system) when often the query could go directly to a [Large Language Model](#large-language-model) (_LLM_) _or_ to an [AI System](#ai-system) that includes one or more LLMs and other &ldquo;components&rdquo;. We will just use AI system queries as a shorthand.

## Accountability

An aspect of [Governance](#governance), where we trace behaviors through [AI Systems](#ai-system) to their causes. Related is the need for organizations to take responsibility for the behaviors of the [AI Systems](#ai-system) they deploy.

## Agent

The AI equivalent of a _component_ or _service_, which orchestrates other components and services in an autonomous or semi-autonomous way to help a user perform a task. Hence, an agent might invoke non-AI tools, such as a web search or a weather reporting service, and use an [LLM](#large-language-model) to both construct queries of these services and to interpret their results, to format a [Response](#response) to the user, etc. Agents may be designed to perform actions automatically for the user, although this &ldquo;power&rdquo; needs to be carefully designed and tested, depending on the severity of unintended consequences. Often, agents are designed to recommend actions the user should take or at least request user confirmation before taking actions. Agents are an old concept in AI research with recent, resurgent interest.

## AI Actor

[\[2\]](#nist) An organization or individual building an [AI System](#ai-system).

## AI System

Umbrella term for an application or system with AI components, including [Datasets](#dataset), [Models](#model), [Evaluation Framework](#evaluation-framework) and [Evaluations](#evaluation) for safety detection and mitigation, etc., plus external services, databases for runtime queries, and other application logic that together provide functionality.

## Alignment

A general term for how well an [AI System's](#ai-system) outputs (e.g., replies to queries) and behaviors correspond to end-user and service provider objectives, including the quality and utility of results, as well as safety requirements. Quality implies factual correctness and utility implies the results are fit for purpose, e.g., a Q&A system should answer user questions concisely and directly, a Python code-generation system should output valid, bug-free, and secure Python code. [EleutherAI defines alignment this way](https://www.eleuther.ai/alignment){:target="eleuther"}, &ldquo;Ensuring that an artificial intelligence system behaves in a manner that is consistent with human values and goals.&rdquo; See also the [Alignment Forum](https://www.alignmentforum.org/){:target="alignment-forum"}.

## Annotation

[\[1\]](#mlc) External data that complements a [Dataset](#dataset), such as labels that classify individual items.

## Benchmark

[\[1\]](#mlc) A methodology or function used for offline [Evaluation](#evaluation) of a [Model](#model) or [AI System](#ai-system) for a particular purpose and to interpret the results. It consists of:
* A set of tests with metrics.
* A summarization of the results.

## ChatBot

An [AI System](#ai-system) application for interactive sessions. It provides a user [Prompt](#prompt) and shows replies generated by the system.

## Classification

Assigning a datum to a category, usually represented by a concise _label_. The categories may be a pre-defined set or discovered by analyzing the data in some way.

## Context

Additional information passed to an [LLM](#large-language-model) as part of a user [Prompt](#prompt), which is intended to provide additional, useful _context_ information so that the [Response](#response) is better than if the user's prompt was passed to the LLM alone. This additional content may include a [System Prompt](#system-prompt), relevant documents retrieved using [RAG](#retrieval-augmented-generation), etc.

## Cybersecurity

The catch-all term for &ldquo;classic&rdquo; security of systems, predating AI. [AI Systems](#ai-system) not only need to correctly implement classic cybersecurity techniques, but AI systems introduce new security concerns.

## Dataset

(See also [\[1\]](#mlc)) A collection of data items used for training, [Evaluation](#evaluation), etc. Usually, a given dataset has a schema (which may be “this is unstructured text”) and some metadata about provenance, licenses for use, transformations and filters applied, etc. 

## Evaluation

The capability of measuring and quantifying how a [Model](#model) or [AI System](#ai-system) that uses models responds to inputs. Much like other software, models and AI systems need to be trusted and useful to their users. Evaluation aims to provide the evidence needed to gain users’ confidence. 

Evaluations can cover functional and nonfunctional dimensions of models, and are applicable throughout the model development and deployment lifecycle. Functional evaluation dimensions include alignment to use cases, accuracy in responses, faithfulness to given context, robustness against perturbations and noise, and adherence to safety and social norms. Nonfunctional evaluation dimensions include latency, throughput, compute efficiency, cost to execute, carbon footprint and other sustainability concerns. Evaluations are applied as regression tests while models are trained and fine-tuned, as benchmarks while GenAI-powered applications are designed and developed, and as guardrails when these applications are deployed in production. They also have a role in compliance, both with specific industry regulations, and with emerging government policies. 

Evaluations can be implemented in many ways. A [Model](#model) might be used to judge results or some executable code might be used for simpler cases. Often an evaluation includes a [Dataset](#dataset), such as question-answer pairs that represent the desired behavior. Other techniques include rule-based systems, evaluation with LLMs acting as judges, and human evaluation.

For our purposes, an evaluation must be executable within an [Evaluation Framework](#evaluation-framework), such our [Evaluation Reference Stack](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/eval-ref-stack/){:target="ers"}. 

## Evaluation Framework

An umbrella term for the software tools, runtime services, benchmark systems, etc. used to run [Evaluations](#evaluation) to measure [AI Systems](#ai-system) behaviors for trust and safety risks and mitigations, and other kinds of measurements.

## Explainability

Can humans understand why the system behaves the way that it does in a particular scenario?

## Fairness

Does the [AI System's](#ai-system) behaviors exhibit social biases, preferential treatment, or other forms of non-objectivity?

## Guardrails

A general term for one or more subsystems in production [AI Systems](#ai-system) that use various techniques, including specialized [Models](#model), to detect and mitigate content in user [Prompts](#prompt) and system [Responses](#response) that is undesirable in some way, such as hate speech, misinformation, hallucinations, etc.

## Governance

End-to-end control of assets, especially [Datasets](#dataset) and [Models](#model), with lineage traceability and access controls for protecting the security and integrity of assets.

## Hallucination

When a [Model](#model) generates text that seems plausible, but is not factually accurate. Lying is not the right term, because there is no malice intended by the model, which only knows how to generate a sequence of [Tokens](#token) that are plausible, i.e., probabilistically likely.

## Inference

Sending a [Prompt](#prompt) to an [AI System](#ai-system) to have it return an analysis of some kind, summarization of the prompt, or newly generated information, such as text or an image. The term _inference_ comes from traditional statistical analysis, including model building, that is used to _infer_ information from data.

## Large Language Model

Abbreviated _LLM_, a state of the art [Model](#model), often with billions of parameters, that has the ability to summarize, classify, and even generate text in one or more spoken and programming languages. See also [Multimodal Model](#multimodal-model).

## Model

A combination of data and code, usually trained on a [Dataset](#dataset), to support [Inference](#inference) of some kind or other processing like [Classification](#Classification). See also [Large Language Model](#large-language-model) and [Multimodal Model](#multimodal-models).

## Multimodal Model

[Models](#model) that extend the text-based capabilities of [LLMs](#large-language-model) with additional support for other media, such as video, audio, still images, or other kinds of data.

## Privacy

Protection of individuals’ sensitive data and preservation of their rights.

## Prompt

The query a user (or another system) sends to an [LLM](#large-language-model). Often, additional [Context](#context) information is added by an [AI System](#ai-system) before sending the prompt to the LLM.

## System Prompt

A commonly-used, statically-coded part of the [Context](#context) information added by an [AI System](#ai-system) the [Prompt](#prompt) before sending it to the [LLM](#large-language-model). System prompts are typically used to provide the model with overall guidance about the application's purpose and how the LLM should respond. For example, it might include phrases like &ldquo;You are a helpful software development assistant.&rdquo;

## Privacy

Protection of individuals’ sensitive data and preservation of their rights.

## Response

The generic term for outputs from a [Model](#model) or [AI System](#ai-system). Sometimes _results_ is also used.

## Responsible AI

(See also [\[2\]](#nist)) An umbrella term about comprehensive approaches to safety, accountability, and equitability. It covers an organization’s professional responsibility to address concerns. It can encompass tools, models, people, processes, integrated systems, and data.

## Retrieval-augmented Generation

RAG was one of the first AI-specific design patterns for applications. It uses one or more data stores with information relevant to an application's use cases. For example, a [ChatBot](#chatbot) for automotive repair technicians would use RAG to retrieve sections from repair manuals and logs from past service jobs, selecting the ones that are most relevant to a particular problem or subsystem the technician is working on. This [Context](#context) is passed as part of the [Prompt](#prompt) to the [LLM](#large-language-model). A key design challenge is determining relevancy and structuring the data so that relevant information is _usually_ retrieved. See [this IBM blog post](https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG){:target="ibm-rag"} for a description of RAG.

## Risk

[\[2\]](#nist) The composite measure of an event’s probability of occurring and the magnitude or degree of the consequences of the corresponding event. Risk is a function of the negative impact if the event occurs and the likelihood of occurrence.

## Robustness

How well does the [AI System](#ai-system) continue to perform within acceptable limits or degrade &ldquo;gracefully&rdquo; when stressed in some way? For example, what is the performance when a [Prompt](#prompt) covers an _out of band_ topic, meaning a topic that wasn't covered in the training data?

## Social Responsibility

[\[2\]](#nist) An organization’s responsibility for the impacts of its decisions and activities on society and the environment through transparent and ethical behavior. 

## Sustainability

(See also [\[2\]](#nist)) Taking into account the environmental impact of [AI Systems](#ai-system), such as carbon footprint and water usage for cooling, both now and for the future.

## Token

For language [Models](#model), the training texts and [Prompts](prompt) are split into tokens, usually whole words or fractions according to a vocabulary of tens of thousands of tokens that can include common single characters, several characters, and &ldquo;control&rdquo; tokens (like &ldquo;end of input&rdquo;). The rule of thumb is a corpus will have roughly 1.5 times the number of tokens as it will have words.
