## Contributing New or Improved Web Site Content

First, thank you for your interest in improving this content!. Please see our [Alliance contributing page](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/community/) for general information about contributing to any of our projects. This section provides some specific details you need to know.

What gets displayed by GitHub Pages is the customized Markdown files in the `docs` directory. If you need to create a new page, copy an existing page to get the correct "header" information, then edit as needed.

Here are some things you should know.

### We Require "Developer Certificate of Origin" (DCO)

> [!WARNING]
> Before you make any git commits with changes, understand what's required for DCO.

See the Alliance contributing guide [section on DCO](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#developer-certificate-of-origin) for details. In practical terms, supporting this requirement means you must use the `-s` flag with your `git commit` commands.
